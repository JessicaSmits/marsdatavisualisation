# A data visualisation of Mars

For my first year and second semester of college I had to make a data visualisation. I choose to visualize the data of mars collected by NASA's Inside rover on Elysium Planitia.
I used NASA's API for my datavisualisation. You can click through the different days.

## Attention
Insight often doesn't measure wind, temperature and pressure for long enough periods of time, to be considered 'valid' data. The minimum amount of hours measuring should be 18.
